The formula for exponential growth is `population_size = N0 *e**rt`, where `N0` is the initial population, `e` is the exponential function, `r` is the rate, and `t` is time. Using this:\n","\n","1.   Set the initial population, `N0`, as 100 and the growth rate, `r`, as 0.4\n","2.   Use the suitable `numpy` function to generate an array of time points, `t`, which go from 0 to 10 seconds, in 0.2 second increments.\n","3.   Write an expression to evaluate `population_size`, which should be an array of the population size for each time point in `t`.\n","4.   Create a new variable called `population_size_noise`, use the same expression you wrote in parts (3), and add noise to the population at each time point. Do this by adding an expression that uses a `numpy` function to generate a random value for each time point drawn from a normal distribution of `mean=0` and `stdev=250` (i.e., population_size_noise = expression_from_part_a + expression_to_add_noise)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":7,"status":"ok","timestamp":1668296875008,"user":{"displayName":"Kaylie Lau","userId":"01284785813595846851"},"user_tz":300},"id":"ULSswoS4EhRs","outputId":"6d541d46-0b4f-4300-9d52-bfd6d4877aff"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["array([ 100.        ,  108.32870677,  117.3510871 ,  127.12491503,\n","        137.71277643,  149.18246976,  161.60744022,  175.06725003,\n","        189.64808793,  205.44332106,  222.55409285,  241.08997064,\n","        261.16964734,  282.92170144,  306.48542033,  332.01169227,\n","        359.66397256,  389.61933018,  422.0695817 ,  457.22251951,\n","        495.30324244,  536.55559711,  581.24373944,  629.6538261 ,\n","        682.09584693,  738.90560989,  800.44689143,  867.11376585,\n","        939.33312874, 1017.56743061, 1102.31763806, 1194.12644178,\n","       1293.58173155, 1401.32036077, 1518.0322245 , 1644.46467711,\n","       1781.42731796, 1929.79717555, 2090.52432351, 2264.63796432,\n","       2453.25301971, 2657.57726999, 2878.91908792, 3118.69581683,\n","       3378.44284638, 3659.82344437, 3964.63940726, 4294.84259788,\n","       4652.54744398, 5040.04447781, 5459.81500331])"]},"execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# Your code here\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","population_N0 = 100\n","growth_rate = 0.4\n","\n","t = np.arange(start = 0, stop= 10.2, step = 0.2)\n","\n","population_size = population_N0 * np.exp(growth_rate *t)\n","\n","population_size"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["<details>\n","  <summary>Answer</summary>\n","\n","  ```python\n","  import numpy as np\n","\n","  #set initial population\n","  N0 = 100\n","  #set growth rate\n","  rate = 0.4\n","  #create array of time points \n","  t = np.arange(start=0, stop=10.2, step=0.2)\n","\n","  #calculate population of colony at the time points in t\n","  population_size = N0 * np.exp(rate*t)\n","  print('Population size is: ',population_size)\n","\n","  #add noise to population at each time point\n","  population_size_noise = N0 * np.exp(rate*t) + np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=250, size=np.shape(population_size))\n","  print('Population size with noise is: ',population_size_noise)\n","  ```\n","</details>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QmxvYhS3OCNJ"},"source":["### 2.
